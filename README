Simple render for Dicom files. 

This is only one thing, that helped our project to get compatibility with .dic files that we had. 
Render based on this: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/10908/DICOM-parser-based-on-DICOM-server-from-dicomapi 
I just removed all MFC junk and wrote wrapper in C#.

Also, I cannot get how to build dcmrender.dll using MSVC 2008 or 2010. So if somebody has an idea, please let me know.

Files cximagecrt.dll and dicomapi.dll is runtime DLLs for dcmrender.dll (without any source code). 
Also, there is four .txt files in ./bin directory. All these files is required by runtime, do not delete it. 

Also, render crashes when dcmrender is built with "Use MFC in a static library" option.
